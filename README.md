# Trumpet Skeleton

This repository is a fork of [the original Trumpet Skeleton mod](https://github.com/JamiesWhiteShirt/trumpet-skeleton) 
and contains a direct port of [the Fabric version of Trumpet Skeleton](https://github.com/JamiesWhiteShirt/trumpet-skeleton-fabric), 
bringing the changes and features from that version over to Forge.

Trumpet Skeleton is a fantastically silly mod, and one that's widely enjoyed by a lot of people. While
Fabric is a fantastic mod loader and developer toolkit and I love how it works and what it stands for,
but the community doesn't seem to be ready to move on from Forge just yet - and that's why I decided
to work on this port.

Once Fabric becomes the primary mod loader in use by the community at large, this port will no longer be
relevant, and I will stop maintaining it. Until then, though, doot on!

I'd like to thank JamiesWhiteShirt for his hard work on this mod, and I hope that it continues to be
popular well into the future!
